                        Welcome to my Portfolio, I'm Oliver, I make websites for all price ranges, giving you a 
                        stylish and proffesional website for your business or personal venture.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        The websites I make are completely bespoke and unique, which is exactly how your website <i>should</i> be. 
                        Your site will be tailor made with its own personal feel for you and for the needs of your company, business, or project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am punctual, efficient and an excellent communicator who knows the value of a smart, stylish, and practical website and web program. So 
                        let's get to work!

                        Welcome to my Portfolio, I'm Oliver, a self-taught front-end developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I favour the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript for my projects, and I am passionate about expanding my knowledge in these languages as well as others, such as the React framework. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can find most of these works on my <i href="programming.html" class="right-text-link">Programming</i> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're looking for a website, then you should know that your website should be completely unqiue and bespoke to your company, business, or project - which is exactly where I come in.
                    </p>

                        <p>Running a business takes time, time which you could be spending on other parts of your business, so why don't you leave the website part to me.</p>

                        <p>Below are a few of the things that I can focus on (depending on your needs) that gives your website an edge.</p>
                        <p>But first it might be worth considering the size of the website that you would like:</p>

                            <p>If you are looking to keep your website simple, small, or possibly aim to have it up and running sooner
                                rather than later, then a single page site might be for you. This would quite likely end up
                                being cheaper than a multi-page website, so if this is what you are looking for then get in contact below!</p>

                            <p>If you were thinking about having more content on your website, and different pages for different secions, then a multi-page 
                                site might be more suited to you. This can give you the oppurtunity to include more information / content and show off your 
                                brand image that little bit more. If this is more up your street
